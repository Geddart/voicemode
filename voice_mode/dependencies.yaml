# VoiceMode System Dependencies
# Organized by: voicemode → component → OS/distribution → package list
#
# ## SUMMARY
#
# ### Installation Tool
# **UV (required for installation):**
# - All platforms: UV package manager (https://astral.sh/uv)
# - Used by install script and for `uv tool install voice-mode`
# - Provides consistent binary location at ~/.local/bin
#
# ### Core (VoiceMode base)
# **Required (runtime):**
# - macOS: portaudio, ffmpeg
# - Ubuntu/Debian: libportaudio2, ffmpeg
# - Fedora: portaudio, ffmpeg
#
# **Required (build tools - for webrtcvad and simpleaudio):**
# - Ubuntu/Debian: python3-dev, gcc, libasound2-dev
# - Fedora: python3-devel, gcc, alsa-lib-devel
# - Note: webrtcvad is a Python C extension used for silence detection. It must be compiled during installation.
#   simpleaudio is a Python C extension used for audio playback. It requires ALSA headers to compile.
#   Testing confirmed: Only gcc is required for core, g++/gcc-c++ not needed.
#
# **Optional (build from source):**
# - Ubuntu/Debian: portaudio19-dev
# - Fedora: portaudio-devel
#
# **Required for WSL:**
# - WSL Ubuntu/Debian: pulseaudio, pulseaudio-utils, libasound2-plugins
# - WSL Fedora: pulseaudio, pulseaudio-utils
# - Note: Must be running for audio to work in WSL2
#
# **Optional (audio server - native Linux):**
# - Usually pre-installed on desktop Linux distributions
#
# ### Kokoro (TTS)
# - macOS: rust (optional)
# - Ubuntu/Debian: cargo, rustc (ARM64 only)
# - Fedora: cargo, rust (ARM64 only)

# Notes:
# - macOS typically uses Homebrew for all packages
# - Linux distributions may need additional repositories (e.g., RPM Fusion for Fedora ffmpeg)
# - ARM64 systems may need Rust for building certain Python packages from source
# - WSL requires PulseAudio to be running for audio support
# - webrtcvad (C extension for silence detection) MUST be compiled during installation on all platforms
#   This requires gcc/g++, python3-dev/python3-devel to be installed before running 'uv tool install voice-mode'
# - Most other Python packages (numpy, scipy, sounddevice, etc.) have pre-built wheels for x86_64
